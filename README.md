# ShoppingBasketHMRC

The project is composed using Spring boot.

In order to work with the project you will need to have maven installed  and java 8 on your machine.

The project takes advantage of some java 8 features

The project is very simple and  only contains core functionality as specified here

Step 1: Shopping cart

● You are building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and oranges.   

● Apples cost 60p and oranges cost 25p. 

● Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till and outputs the total cost 

● For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] => £2.05 

● Make reasonable assumptions about the inputs to your solution; for example, many candidates take a list of strings as input 

Step 2: Simple offers

● The shop decides to introduce two new offers 

○ buy one, get one free on Apples 

○ 3 for the price of 2 on Oranges 

● Update your checkout functions accordingly 




There is a test suite which touches on some basic tests for the simple functionality requested above.


in order to run the test you can simply run mvn clean install from the command line.


The code is tagged on step1  and step 2 so you can check the changes applied. accross both revisions.
